# for my first FEWD project, I've been tasked with creating a website layout

# core concept 
the core concept im going with is blog theme/alternatively styled web page for artists. 
# challenges 

     need an artist page of my own, however I dont have much work available offline. So the larger challenge at hand was creating a layout that works with my limited portfolio. 

    Another challenge that i was working with was creating a page that allowed me to show off my diverse selection of works. Though I may not have many works; all my work is spread between multiple genres and mediums. For example, some of my work is audio, some of it is traditional illustration, and some of it is digital illustration/animation. 

    Without overthinking it I'm seeking to create a web layout that effectively puts everything in one or two places.

# primary layout ideas 

    Taking approach to making an artist feed for updates instead of taking the approach of making a website that exemplifies a large portfolio.
